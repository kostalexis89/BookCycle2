Now in this repository I will rebuild the client side from scratch. My purpsose is to write readable code, as well applying the best practices regarding the needs of this project


## A few words about BookCycle
About a year ago, when I moved in Berlin I was looking for Greek-books. It was impossible to find some, so I came up with this project-idea.

An application that helps users trade their books...
I am using an API from https://openlibrary.org/ .
The user signs up and login and then they can add their books by ISBN-13. Then they can add it in their private library and the trip beggins.
